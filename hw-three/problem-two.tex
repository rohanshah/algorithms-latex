\section*{Problem 2.}
Consider the following strategy for the hunter to catch the rabbit in
expected polynomial time. The hunter chooses a vertex $v$ uniformly at random,
takes the shortest path to $v$ of length $l$ and waits at $v$ for $n-l$ time
steps i.e. each round takes $n$ time steps total. Since the rabbit has no
knowledge of the starting position of the hunter, the probability that the
hunter chose the vertex that the rabbit would be at at time $n$ is $\frac{1}{n}$.
Therefore, in expectation, the hunter will have correctly guessed the position
that the rabbit will be at after $n$ rounds. Since each round takes $n$ time
steps the total number of expected time steps is $n^2$.
