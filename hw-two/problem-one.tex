\section*{Problem 1.}
Consider the transpose permutation, where each packet has a source node of
the form $a_ib_i$ and a destination node of the form $b_ia_i$ where $a_i$
and $b_i$ are binary strings of length $\frac{n}{2}$. Now consider the
$2^{\frac{n}{2}}$ packets whose $b_i = 0^{\frac{n}{2}}$. We now consider the
probability that such a packet passes through the node $0^n$ during its routing.
Each packet has some number, say $k$, $1$'s in its $a_i$. For a packet to pass
through the node $0^n$, the bit-fixing algorithm must fix all $k$ $1$'s to
$0$'s in $a_i$ before fixing any of the $k$ $0$'s to $1$'s in $b_i$, i.e. the
first $k$ bits the algorithm fixes must all be in $a_i$. Since the algorithm
fixes bits in random order, there is only one set of selections from the
${2k \choose k}$ possible combinations for the selection of the first $k$ bits
fixed, the probability that a packet with $k$ $1$'s in its $a_i$ passes through
$0^n$ is $\frac{1}{{2k \choose k}}$.
Since there are $2^{\frac{n}{2}}$ such packets total, for a fixed $k$ there are
${\frac{n}{2} \choose k}$ packets, so the expected number of such packets given
a fixed $k$ to pass through $0^n$ is
$${\frac{n}{2} \choose k} \cdot \frac{1}{{2k \choose k}}$$
From the given inequalities we have
$$\left(\frac{\frac{n}{2}}{k}\right)^k \le {\frac{n}{2} \choose k} \text{ and }
{2k \choose k} \le \left(\frac{2ke}{k}\right)^k$$
which gives
$$\frac{{\frac{n}{2} \choose k}}{{2k \choose k}} \ge
\frac{\left(\frac{\frac{n}{2}}{k}\right)^k}{\left(\frac{2ke}{k}\right)^k} =
\left(\frac{n}{4ek}\right)^k$$
If we fix $k = \frac{n}{8e}$ then the expected number of packets being routed
through $0^n$ is
$$\left(\frac{n}{4e\cdot \frac{n}{8e}}\right)^{\frac{n}{8e}} =
2^{\frac{n}{8e}} = 2^{\Omega(n)}$$.
