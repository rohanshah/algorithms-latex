\section*{Problem 1.}
Consider the transpose permutation, where each packet has a source node of
the form $a_ib_i$ and a destination node of the form $b_ia_i$ where $a_i$
and $b_i$ are binary strings of length $n/2$. Now consider the
$2^{n/2}$ packets whose $b_i = 0^{n/2}$. Each such packet has $k$ $1$'s in its
$a_i$, and equivalently, $k$ $0$'s in its $b_i$ that need to be flipped in order
for the packet to complete its routing. For some fixed $k$ there are
${n/2 \choose k}$ such packets. Let $X = X_1 + \cdots + X_{{n/2 \choose k}}$
where $X_i$ is a binary random variable such that $X_i = 1$ if the $i$-th
packet of the above form passes through the node $0^n$, for some such fixed $k$.
Since the algorithm fixes bits in random order, there is only one set of
selections from the ${2k \choose k}$ possible combinations for the selection of the first $k$ bits
fixed. Therefore we have
$$\textbf{Pr}[X_i = 1] = {2k \choose k}^{-1}$$
Since each $X_i$ are independent binary random variables we have that
$\textbf{E}[X_i] = \textbf{Pr}[X_i = 1]$ and by the linearity of expectation
we have
$$\textbf{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{{n/2 \choose k}} {2k \choose k}^{-1} =
\frac{{n/2 \choose k}}{{2k \choose k}}$$
From the given inequalities we have
$$\left(\frac{n/2}{k}\right)^k \le {n/2 \choose k} \text{ and }
{2k \choose k} \le \left(\frac{2ke}{k}\right)^k$$
which gives
$$\frac{{n/2 \choose k}}{{2k \choose k}} \ge
\frac{\left(\frac{n/2}{k}\right)^k}{\left(\frac{2ke}{k}\right)^k} =
\left(\frac{n}{4ek}\right)^k$$
If we fix $k = \frac{n}{8e}$ then the expected number of packets being routed
through $0^n$ is at least
$$\left(\frac{n}{4e\cdot \frac{n}{8e}}\right)^{\frac{n}{8e}} =
2^{\frac{n}{8e}} = 2^{\Omega(n)}$$
Since each packet is routed independently at random we can use Chernoff bound to
show:
$$\textbf{Pr}[X < \frac{2^{\Omega(n)}}{2}]
\le \frac{1}{e^{\frac{2^{\Omega(n)}}{8}}}$$
So with high probability, at least $\frac{2^{\Omega(n)}}{2}$ packets pass
through node $0^n$ so at least $\frac{2^{\Omega(n)}}{2n} = 2^{\Omega(n)}$ steps are
required to complete the routing.
